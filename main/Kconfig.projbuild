            Basic Authentication is a method for an HTTP user agent (e.g. a web browser)
            to provide a user name and password when making a request. It is the simplest
            technique for enforcing access controls to web resources. because it doesn't
            require cookies, session identifiers, or login pages; rather, it uses standard
            fields in the HTTP header.
            Note that, Basic Authentication is not encrypted channel and also easy to retrieve
            credentials as they are sent in plain text format.

            This will allow the server to push real-time updates to the client over an HTTP connection.
